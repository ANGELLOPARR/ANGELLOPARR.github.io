		<h3>A little about me...</h3>

		<p class="first">I am a student at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. <em>Boy that's a mouthful</em>. I'm currently studying to get a B.S. in Computer Science, and I'm hoping to get a minor in Data Science and eventually go to graduate school for an M.S. or Ph.D. in Computer Science with an emphasis on Machine/Deep Learning, Data Science, and Computer Vision.</p>

		<p>I have <em>way too many hobbies</em> than I have time for. Most days I'm just your normal day-to-day student. I often am in class or reading textbooks for my classes from around 8 am to 4pm, which is usually when I'll start getting all my homework done for the week. When I have some free time though, I enjoy coding, cooking, surfing, and running. It's nice when I have a gap in homework so I can continue working on a project I have or my web development course, and when I've been sitting and typing for a long while, I'll usually balance it out with a mile run and a gym session or a couple hours of surfing. Having been born and raised in Bakersield, California (2 hours away from anywhere fun and always scorching hot) living in San Luis Obispo is an <strong>amazing</strong> step up from my old lifestyle. On the weekends I like to relax, hang out with my buddies, eat good food, and prepare for the week so that I don't get slammed with homework and responsibilities all at once.</p>

		<p>If you've actually made it this far into my "About Me" page, you are probably either genuinely interested in hearing my story, in which case I would like to extend a <strong>Thank You</strong> for the interest, or you are a potential employer scouting my profile, trying to measure my web development performance, in which case I would again like to extend a genuine <strong>Thank You</strong> for your interest. I hope you'll enjoy the product of my time and effort that is this website. I'm an ambitious, honest, dedicated, and eager student trying to get hands-on experience with anything in the tech / software world. Since my first Computer Science Class in high school I was hooked onto the world of software development and tech. Watching my personal role models like Elon Musk release technology like self-driving cars and seeing companies develop super-intelligent A.I. that can beat the best humans in games like Go, Chess, and Dota 2 further lured me into seeing all of the amazing possibilities that Computer Science gives to us. The ability to start with a blank .txt or .python or .java file and develop software that interacts with the outside world using just brainpower, will, and a keyboard is––<em>I think</em>––too often taken for granted, and I can't wait to see what I will accomplish in the future with my <strong>canvas</strong> that is my <strong>laptop</strong>, and my <strong>brush</strong> that is <strong>programming</strong>.</p>
